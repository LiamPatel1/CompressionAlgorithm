This is a NEA project I completed for my Computer Science A-Level Coursework:


# lp-archiver

Required packages: pillow, cryptography

## Instructions:

- Run main.py
- In the main window, the pane on the left is the shortcuts pane, and on the right is the explorer pane.
- The file explorer can be navigated by double clicking on a folder in either pane to open it, or by typing the directory into the bar at the top.
- If all the folders do not fit on the frame, you can scroll using the bars on the right.
- Navigate to the folder containing the file or folder to be compressed, then single click it, then right click it and press "Add to archive".
- This will open a new window containing an entry to where you want the compressed file to output to. Press "Confirm".
- This will create an archive. This archive can be decompressed by right-clicking and pressing "Decompress Archive".
- The Arrow button in the top left will take you out of the current directory and show its parent folder.
- You can add a folder to the shortcuts pane on the left by right clicking a folder in the explorer and pressing "Add to shortcuts".
- Shortcuts can be removed by right clicking a file in the shortcuts pane and pressing "Remove from shortcuts"
- You can change the colour of the program with the options bar at the top.
